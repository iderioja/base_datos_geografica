Logroño (Spain) February 5th, 2014

Several months ago, encouraged by the possibility that GitHub offered us to visualize GeoJson files in the form of interactive maps, we considered the possibility of using this platform to distribute our geographic data.

Initially, we started by creating the repository “cartografía _ temática” (thematic cartography), in which, up to now, and in a traditional way, we have uploaded different geographic layers.

During these months we have learned and discovered the possibilities that GitHub offered us, which has increased the level of our expectations and demands.

The final challenge was clear: since we already have a geographic database that daily collects the contributions of many colleagues from various departments within our administration, why not try to make this information available to our users as it is produced?

The ETL tools that we have, offered us the possibility to automate the extraction and transformation of the geographic information of our repository and its transfer to GitHub.

It has not been an easy task since we could not find similar experiences from which to learn; however, we have finally reached our goal.

In this repository you can already find the most updated different layers of geographic information. From the producer to the consumer in record time.

Unfortunately, the limitations imposed by GitHub in relation to the size of the folders have prevented us from providing you with the whole information. However, we offer you the possibility to access directly to our [Geografic Database] (http://ias1.larioja.org/iderioja/ANONIMO_INSPIRE_INGLES) and to use all the tools for searching, exporting and consulting information that our database offers.

We believe that all the work can always be improved, including ours. For this reason, we really appreciate any opinions, suggestions or criticisms that you may express in this matter and that, as always, you can address to iderioja@larioja.org

To conclude, we just want to remind you that in this repository you can consult the details and the terms of service; we encourage you to do it. We have recently updated the terms of service to the new Creative Commons CC By 4.0 version for all the information produced exclusively by the Government of La Rioja, without the collaboration of other entities or administrations.

We hope that you find the information that we hereby deposit useful.


Kind Regards,
